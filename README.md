# nodejs-ci-demo

 hereâ€™s a **clear, step-by-step summary** of everything you've done so far to build and test a Node.js app with CI using GitHub Actions.

---

## âœ… Project Summary: Node.js App with GitHub CI Pipeline

---

### ðŸŸ© **1. Initialized the Project**

* Created a GitHub repository: `nodejs-ci-demo`
* Cloned it to your local machine
* Initialized a Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

---

### ðŸŸ© **2. Built a Simple Node.js App with Express**

* Installed Express:

```bash
npm install express
```

* Created an `index.js` file with a basic Express server:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

---

### ðŸŸ© **3. Fixed `package.json`**

You had a syntax issue. The corrected `package.json` now looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "nodejs-ci-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"No tests yet\" && exit 0"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/lamideh1/nodejs-ci-demo.git"
  },
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  }
}
```

---

### ðŸŸ© **4. Ran the App Locally**

```bash
npm start
```

Output:

```
App listening at http://localhost:3000
```

Opened browser â†’ saw `Hello World!` at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### ðŸŸ© **5. Set Up GitHub Actions CI Pipeline**

Created a GitHub Actions workflow file at:

```
.github/workflows/node.js.yml
```

With the content:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: npm test
```

---

### ðŸŸ© **6. Fixed Common CI Errors**

* Fixed `package.json` syntax
* Fixed malformed `index.js` (missing `()` and incorrect syntax)
* Deleted and regenerated `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

* Committed and pushed changes to trigger clean builds

---

### ðŸŸ© **7. Successfully Passed the CI Workflow**

Your Node.js app now:

* Runs locally without errors
* Has a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
* Can be extended for testing, deployment, and more

---

## âœ… What You Can Do Next

Here are your next possible steps:

1. **Add automated tests** (e.g., with Jest or Mocha)
2. **Set up deployment** (to Heroku, Render, or Vercel)
3. **Dockerize the app** for containerized CI/CD
4. **Monitor builds** and handle pull request merges with confidence
